        <li>Project 1:
            This project is my first personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience in web development.
            In this project, you will create a simple personal portfolio website and use Git and GitHub to manage the version control of your project.
            You'll create a repository, track changes, and collaborate (if desired). The website can be as simple as an HTML page with your personal information, 
            skills, and projects.

            Key Skills You Will Learn:
              -> Initializing a Git repository
              -> Staging and committing changes
              ->Creating branches and merging
              ->Pushing your work to GitHub
              ->Collaborating with others using pull requests (optional)
        </li>
